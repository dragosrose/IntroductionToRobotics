## Homework 1

<b>Technical task: </b> Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the
color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done
with digital electronics (aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected
to the led.)

<b>Components:</b> 1 RBG LED, 3 potentiometers,
resistors and wires

## Homework 2

<b>Technical task: </b> Setup that simulates the behavior of real-life traffic lights for a crosswalk. 2 LEDs (red and green) represent the traffic lights for people, whereas 3 LEDs (red, yellow and green) are for the cars.

<b>Components:</b> 5 LEDs, 1 push buttons, resistors and wires
